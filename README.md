AccuKnox Assignment â€“ DVWA on Kubernetes

Project Overview  
This project is part of the assignment for AccuKnox. I deployed a vulnerable web application called **DVWA** using **Kubernetes** on my local system. The goal was to understand how security issues can happen in cloud environments and how attackers might target them.

What I Did  
- Deployed DVWA in Kubernetes using YAML files  
- Used Minikube for local Kubernetes setup  
- Tested for security issues using basic scanning tools  

Tools Used  
- Kubernetes (Minikube)  
- Docker  
- DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)  
- Kali Linux  
- Nmap and Nikto (for testing)  

How to Run  
1. Start Minikube:
2. Apply the YAML files:
3. Open DVWA in browser:


What I Learned  
- How to run apps in Kubernetes  
- Found common security problems in web apps  
- Learned how scanning tools help in finding issues  

About Me  
I am a fresher with cybersecurity training. I enjoy learning about cloud security and want to build secure systems using tools like Kubernetes.
